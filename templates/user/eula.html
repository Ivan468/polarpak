<p>YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT BEFORE INSTALLING THIS SOFTWARE PROGRAM. BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE  SOFTWARE PROGRAM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE CONTACT VIART SOFTWARE AT  HTTP://WWW.VIART.COM TO ARRANGE A FULL REFUND.</p>

<p>This software program, and any files that are delivered to you by ViArt Software (via on-line transmission or otherwise) to "patch," update, or otherwise modify  the software program, as well as any printed materials and any on-line or electronic documentation (the "Manual"), and any and all copies and derivative  works of such software program and materials (collectively the "Software") are the copyrighted work of ViArt Software, or its suppliers and licensors  (collectively referred to herein as "Licensor"). All use of the Software is governed by the terms of this End User License Agreement ("License Agreement" or  "Agreement"). The Software is distributed solely for use by authorized end users according to the terms of the License Agreement. Any use, reproduction or  redistribution of the Software not expressly authorized by the terms of the License Agreement is expressly prohibited.</p>

<p><b>1. Ownership.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. All title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Software and all copies thereof (including, but not limited to, any titles, computer code, artwork, any related documentation, and "applets" incorporated into the Software) are owned or expressly licensed by Licensor. The  Software is protected by the copyright laws of the United Kingdom, international copyright treaties and conventions, and other laws. All rights are reserved.  The Software may contain certain licensed materials, and the licensors of those materials may enforce their rights in the event of any violation of this  License Agreement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Each license purchased for this Software allows the Software to be used on one website domain only. You may not copy or use the Software on another domain without obtaining, in advance, a new license for the new domain and/or express permission from ViArt Software. You may only permanently transfer ownership of the Software and all parts thereof, and all of your rights and obligations under the License Agreement, to another domain or owner, once you have notified ViArt Software. In this case ViArt Software will issue a license for the new domain once it has been established that the old domain is no longer in use.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Any type of ViArt Software license does not have the end term of use and is given for life time. Each license could be updated to use with new ViArt Software version for free within specified period:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light Edition - 6 months<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Edition - 9 months<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprise Edition - 12 months<br><br>

The free updates period is calculated from the date of the license purchase not from the date it is activated. When free updates period expires you can extend it by paying a non-refundable Updates Period Extension fee. Along with extending license updates period you receive a right to change the domain it is activated on but only one time (for any edition).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. You are entitled to change the domain activated on the license:<br>
Light Edition - one time within 6 months from the date of purchase<br>
Standard Edition - two times within 9 months from the date of purchase<br>
Enterprise Edition - three times within 12 months from the date of purchase<br><br>

When this time expires you should buy Updates Period Extension to change domain. If you used all attempts and updates period is still valid you should buy Extra Activation on Upgrade Version page.</p>  

<p><b>2. Responsibilities of End User.</b></p>

<p>Subject to the Grant of License hereinabove, you may not, in whole or in part, copy, photocopy, reproduce, translate,  reverse engineer, derive source code, modify, disassemble, decompile, or create derivative works based on the Software, or remove any proprietary notices or  labels on the Software, with the exception of the non-compiled source files provided with the Software, including but not limited to template files and  script files, which may be modified for use on the domain specified in part 1 only.

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR  ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

You have no interest, monetary or otherwise, in any feature or content contained in the Software.</p>

<p><b>7. Miscellaneous.</b></p>

<p>This License Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the United Kingdom without regard to conflicts of law provisions,  and any dispute arising hereunder shall be resolved in accordance with the law of the United Kingdom. You agree that any claim asserted in any legal  proceeding by one of the parties against the other shall be commenced and maintained in the United Kingdom, having subject matter jurisdiction with respect  to the dispute between the parties. In the event that any provision of this License Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent  jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining portions of this License Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect. This License Agreement constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject  matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements.</p>

<p>I hereby acknowledge that I have read and understand the foregoing License Agreement and agree that the action of installing the Software is an acknowledgment of my agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of the License Agreement contained herein. </p>
